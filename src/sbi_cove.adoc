== Confidential VM Extension (CoVE) SBI extension proposal
This section describes the normative Confidential VM Extension (CoVE) SBI
extension. This specification introduces four new extensions:

* Supervisor Domains Enumeration Extension (EXT_SUPD)
* CoVE Host Extension (EXT_COVH)
* CoVE Interrupt Extension (EXT_COVI)
* CoVE Guest Extension (EXT_COVG)

=== CoVE FID namespaces

Implementations may support more than one confidential supervisor domain. In
order to support that scenario, as shown in <<cove-fid>>, the most significant 6
bits of the SBI Function Id for the CoVE Extension may be set by the host to
specify the target Supervisor Domain Identifier/TSM for the CoVH or COVI
function invoked. For guest-invoked COVG functions, the RDSM must specify the
Supervisor Domain Identifier for the callee. `a6` bits [16..25] are reserved for
future use. `a6` bits [0..15] are used by the host to specify the CoVE functions
as allocated in <<table_cove_fid_namespaces>>.

  {bits:  16, name: 'FID'},
  {bits:  10, name: 'Reserved'},
  {bits:   6, name: 'SDID'},
], config:{lanes: 1, hspace:1024}}
....

Other future specifications (e.g., CoVE-IO) may need to extend one of the three
CoVE SBI extensions with domain specific functions. In order to support that
requirement each one of the CoVE extensions SBI function IDs (`FID`) in the
availabe 64K range is split into separate namespaces.

The main CoVE specification uses SBI's function identifiers (FIDs) from 0 to
1023 (inclusive), and other specifications can extend the CoVE SBI by reserving
a FID range after 1024.

Below are the reserved CoVE FID namespaces:

=== TEEI - COVH runtime interface
ECALL invocation from VS-mode (guest OS) causes traps that are handled by the
TSM module (enforced via `medeleg` configuration). The TSM then may provide
intrinsics via the COVG (CoVE-Guest ABI) to the TVM to provide attestation
and other trusted services. The TSM may allow the TEE (application or VM)
to request host (untrusted) services via the COVH (CoVE host-ABI).

==== Operational model for the CoVE Host Extension
Executing confidential workloads in a CoVE-enabled system requires a sequence of
one or more of the steps detailed below. These steps are performed by the
non-TCB hosting entity like the OS/VMM (host) in conjunction with the TSM.

. Platform TSM detection and capability enumeration.
. Conversion of non-confidential memory to confidential memory.
. TEE VM (TVM) creation.
. Donating confidential memory to the TSM for TVM page management.
. Defining TVM confidential memory regions.
. Mapping TVM code and data payload to confidential-memory regions.
. Creating TVM vCPUs.
. Finalizing TVM creation.
. Scheduling TVM execution.
. Management of TVM secure interrupts.
. Handling and servicing TVM faults and exits.
. Mapping TVM demand-zero confidential memory regions.
. Mapping TVM non-confidential shared pages on demand.
. Processing TVM-access to MMIO regions.
. Tearing down TVMs.
. Reassignment of confidential memory for other TVMs.
. Reclaiming confidential memory for non-confidential VMs.

===== Platform TSM detection and capability enumeration
Platform support for the TSM can be detected by probing for the EXT_COVE and
then calling `sbi_cove_get_active_domains()` to get information about active
supervisor domains that may support CoVE. The next step is to probe for EXT_COVH
extension, and then calling `sbi_covh_get_tsm_info()` to get information about
the current status of the TSM. The TSM must be in `TSM_READY` in order to
process further ECALLs.

===== TVM creation
A TVM might be created in two ways:
(1) the OS/VMM requests the TSM to promote an existing VM to a TVM using a
single COVH call,
(2) the OS/VMM assembles a TVM under the TSM's supervision in a sequence of
COVH calls.

To promote a non-confidential VM to a TVM, the OS/VMM invokes the
`sbi_covh_promote_to_tvm()`, presenting the VM's state (the CPU state, VM's
data, page tables) to the TSM. The TSM then measures and then copies the entire
VM's state into confidential memory. This is performed as a single operation
after which the newly created TVM is in the `TVM_RUNNABLE` state.

[NOTE]
====
Creating a TVM in a single step reduces the number of ABI calls, thus simplifies
the TSM and OS/VMM implementation. However, it will block the CPU for the
duration of the TVM creation.
====

In the second approach, VMM assembles the TVM in a sequence of calls to TSM. The
first call is `sbi_covh_create_tvm()` that creates a TVM in `TVM_INITIALIZING`
state. With subsequent calls to TSM, VMM requests assignment of confidential
memory for page tables, payload mapping, and vCPUs. The last call transitions
TVM into the `TVM_RUNNABLE` state.

===== TVM memory management
The host is responsible for the following memory management functions:

. Converting non-confidential memory to confidential memory.
. Donating confidential memory for the TVM page-table pool.
. Defining confidential memory regions.
. Mapping TVM code and data payload to confidential TVM-pages.
. Mapping zero-page confidential pages to the TVM regions.
. Mapping non-confidential pages TVM-defined regions for shared-pages / MMIO.

[NOTE]
====
The division into confidential and non-confidential memory might be done
statically or dynamically. CoVE implementations that support only static
partitioning of confidential and non-confidential memory (for example
<<appendix_d>>) might partition the memory during platform initialization before
execution of untrusted code, and thus do not need to implement above ABI.
====

===== Converting non-confidential memory to confidential memory
Platform memory is non-confidential by default, and must be converted to
confidential memory before use with TVMs. The conversion process is initiated by
designating the host physical pages that are to be converted, and then issuing
fence operations to ensure that all outstanding TLB entries to the
non-confidential memory are flushed across all CPUs/harts on the platform. This
ensures that there's no overlapping mapping between the confidential and
non-confidential memory regions on the platform.

This requires the host to make three separate ECALLs to the TSM:

. `sbi_covh_convert_pages()`
. `sbi_covh_global_fence()`
. `sbi_covh_local_fence()`

The memory conversion process is complete when sbi_covh_local_fence() is
successfully completed
on the CPU/hart on the platform.

Converted memory can be assigned to TVMs, but cannot be repurposed for
non-confidential operations
unless it's reclaimed. If the host assigns converted memory to non-confidential
VMs, or uses it for
page-table mappings, access to the converted memory from inside the
non-confidential VM will cause
an access fault.

===== Defining confidential memory regions
The host can declare the TVM physical address ranges for mapping confidential
memory. There can be multiple ranges,
but no two regions can overlap. The region can be sparsely mapped; however, any
sparsely mapped confidential page that's
demand-paged following an access fault by the TVM can only be a demand-zero
page.

All ranges must be defined by calling `sbi_covh_finalize_tvm()`.

===== Donating confidential pages for the TVM page-table pool
The host must ensure that the TSM has sufficient confidential memory for
mapping and managing TVM page-tables
for the code and data payloads by calling `sbi_covh_add_tvm_page_table_pages()`.

===== Mapping TVM code and data payload to confidential TVM-pages
The host can create a confidential page region by calling
`sbi_covh_add_tvm_memory_region()`.
The region can be sparsely populated, and since the host cannot directly access
confidential memory, it must copy the TVM code and data payload from
non-confidential memory to confidential memory by calling
`sbi_covh_add_tvm_measured_pages()`. This operation requires the host to convert
a sufficient number of non-confidential pages to confidential by calling
`sbi_covh_convert_pages()` or by using converted pages that aren't currently
assigned to a TVM. The TSM copies the payload for the TVM from non-confidential
pages to confidential pages and extends the corresponding measurements for the
TVM.

===== vCPU shared state
Host needs access to some of the TVM CSRs and GPRs to handle TVM exits. For
example, the host needs `htval` to determine the fault address, `a0`-`a7` GPRs
to handle forwarded ECALLs and so on. For this purpose, the host and
TSM use the Nested Acceleration (NACL) extension based shared memory interface
<<RVINACL>>, from now on called NACL shared memory to avoid confusion with shared
memory pages between TVM and the host.

The NACL shared memory interface is between TSM and the host and TSM is
responsible for writing any trap-related CSRs and GPRs needed by the host to
handle the exception. The TSM is also responsible for reading the returned
results from NACL shared memory and forwarding it to the TVM.
For single-step TVM creation, OS/VMM also uses NACL shared memory to reflect the
VM's state to the TSM. Further details about which CSRs and GPRs are used by the
TSM and the host can be found in <<table_tsm_csr_updates_in_nacl>>.

The layout of NACL shared memory is shown below as `struct nacl_shmem` and
`scratch` space layout for TSM is shown as
`struct tsm_shmem_scratch`.

-------------------

The below table describes the list of CSRs and GPRs that the TSM and the host
are supposed to use from NACL shared memory.
It also describes the operation allowed for each entity in terms of `R` (read)
and `W` (write) permissions. Note that the TSM
and the host can read/write to any of the fields without any faults but the
permissions depict the expected use case. For write only accesses to
CSRs or GPRs, TSM is supposed to ignore any modifications by the host. TSM
should only take modifications from CSRs or GPRs, e.g., `a0` and `a1` GPRs,
when it has the read permission.

|===
| *CSRs*     | *TSM* | *Host* | *Purpose*
| htinst     |  W    |  R     | TSM writes the faulting instruction into htinst
                                to allow the host to emulate the MMIO.
| htval      |  W    |  R     | In case of a guest page-fault, TSM writes the

| htimedelta |  W    |  R     | TSM writes the guest htimedelta in this CSR.
                                This is to allow a host to schedule an internal

interrupt ticking.
| vstimecmp  |  W    |  R     | TSM writes the guest's vstimecmp to allow the

                                useful in waking up a guest's vcpu when it is
                                sleeping due to a `WFI` instruction.

                                reflected from the host to the TSM during the
                                single-step TVM creation.
|===

[TIP]
====
It's recommended that the TSM should transform the load or store instruction
to/from `a0` before writing to the `htinst` CSR.
So that `a0` will be the only GPR used for MMIO emulation reducing the GPRs
accessible to the host.
====

===== vCPU creation
During assembly of a TVM, the host must register CPUs/harts with the TSM before
they can be used for TVM execution by calling `sbi_covh_create_tvm_vcpu()`. The
NACL shared memory interface is used between the host and the TSM for processing
TVM exits from `sbi_covh_run_tvm_vcpu()`.

[NOTE]
====
Note that the vCPU creation procedure is not required for TVMs created in a
single step (via `sbi_covh_promote_to_tvm()`) because the TSM creates all TVM's
vCPUs at once. All TVM's vCPUs are in the reset state, except for the vCPU whose
state was presented to the TSM at the time of promotion. The vCPUs initial
states are part of the TVM's measurement.
====

===== Finalization of TVM creation
The OS/VMM that finishes the assembly of a TVM, i.e., assignment of memory and
vCPU resources to a TVM, transitions the guest into a `TVM_RUNNABLE` state by
calling `sbi_covh_finalize_tvm()`.
The host must set up TVM Boot vCPU execution parameters like the
entrypoint (`ENTRY_PC`) and boot argument (`ENTRY_ARG`) using arguments to
`sbi_covh_finalize_tvm()`. Note that some COVH calls are no longer permissible
after this transition.

[NOTE]
====
Note that a TVM created via `sbi_covh_promote_to_tvm()` does not require
finalization, because it is already in the `TVM_RUNNABLE` state with a valid
entrypoint, which corresponds to the vCPU state presented to the TSM at the
time of promotion to a TVM.
====

===== TVM execution
The host can then call `sbi_covh_run_tvm_vcpu()` to begin execution. The host
must run the TVM Boot vCPU first otherwise `sbi_covh_run_tvm_vcpu()` call will
fail. TVM execution continues until there is an event like an interrupt, or
fault that cannot be serviced by the TSM. Some interrupts and exceptions are
resumable, and the host can determine specific reason by examining the `scause`
CSR. The host can then examine the NACL shared memory if needed to determine
further course of action. This may involve servicing exits caused by TVM-ECALLs
that require host action (like adding MMIO region or share memory with the host)
, TVM page-faults, virtual instructions, etc.

===== Mapping confidential demand-zero pages and non-confidential shared pages
The host can handle TVM page-faults by determining whether it was caused by
access to a confidential or non-confidential region. In the former case, it can
use `sbi_covh_add_tvm_zero_pages()` to populate the region with a previously
converted confidential page. The TSM verifies that the confidential
page isn't currently in use, and zeroes it out before assigning it to the TVM.
Demand-zero pages have no bearing on the TVM measurement, and can be added at
any point in time.

The host can process non-confidential pages by calling
`sbi_covh_add_shared_pages()`. Non-confidential shared memory regions are
defined by the TVM using the EXT_COVG extension.

===== Handling MMIO faults
TVMs can define MMIO regions using the EXT_COVG extension, and a runtime access
to such a region causes
a resumable exit from the TVM. The host can examine the exit code from `scause`
CSR, and when the exception
is a guest load/store page fault, the host will check if the fault address
belongs to any of the registered MMIO
emulation regions. The fault address information comes from `stval` and `htval`
CSRs. After emulation, the host
updates the NACL shared memory region as appropriate and resumes TVM execution.
This process also involves instruction
decoding using the `htinst` CSR from the NACL shared memory region.

===== Handling virtual instructions
The host can handle exits caused by virtual instruction by examining and
decoding the contents of the
NACL shared memory region.

===== Management of secure interrupts
The host can use the TEE Interrupt Extension (EXT_COVI) to manage secure TVM
interrupts on platforms with AIA support, or present these interrupts via HVIP
when resuming the vCPU execution via `sbi_covh_run_tvm_vcpu()` on platforms
without AIA support.

===== TVM teardown
The host can teardown a TVM by calling `sbi_covh_destroy_tvm()`. This
automatically releases all
confidential memory assigned to the TVM, and it can be repurposed for use with
other TVMs. However,
reclaiming the memory for use by non-confidential workloads requires an
explicit call to
`sbi_covh_reclaim_pages()`.

==== Operational model for the CoVE Guest Extension
This interface is used by TVMs to communicate with TSM. Presently, this
extension allows guests
to define memory regions for MMIO emulation by host, share pages with the host
and control interrupt
injection by host.

===== TVM-defined MMIO regions
TVM can register the physical address location as a non-confidential MMIO
region at runtime to be emulated by the host.
This is done by calling `sbi_covg_add_mmio_region()`. This results in an exit
to the host, and it can retrieve the
information by checking the exit code from the TVM and examining the NACL
shared memory region. The expectation
is that the host will service a subsequent page-fault that results from a
TVM-access to the non-confidential region.

===== TVM-defined shared memory regions
TVMs can choose to yield access to confidential memory at runtime and request
shared (non-confidential) memory.
The TVM must communicate its request to the host to convert confidential to
non-confidential and vice-versa
explicitly via the `sbi_covg_share_memory_region()` and
`sbi_covg_unshare_memory_region()`. This request
results in an exit to the TSM which enforces the security properties on the
mapping and exits to the VMM host.
If the region of address space is populated, the host must first invalidate and
remove the confidential pages.
This requires the host to make three separate ECALLs to the TSM:

. `sbi_covh_tvm_invalidate_pages()`
. `tee_host_tvm_initiate_fence()`
. `sbi_covh_tvm_remove_pages()`

Upon completion of the invalidation of references to confidential memory, the
host may reclaim the confidential pages that were previously mapped in the
region using `tee_host_tsm_reclaim_pages()`. The host must then continue the
TVM execution and insert shared pages into the region using
`tee_host_tvm_add_shared_pages()` on the page-fault when TVM tries to access
the region. If the region of address space is unpopulated, the page removal
ECALLs are not needed and the host can insert shared pages into the region on
the next page-fault.

The calling TVM vCPU is considered blocked until the assignment-change is
completed. Attempts to run it with `sbi_covh_run_tvm_vcpu()` will fail.
Any guest page faults taken by other TVM vCPUs in the invalidated pages
continue to be reported to the host.

Note that the TVM vCPU is blocked until the host completes the conversion to
shared memory - this sequence may happen in two parts - invalidation of
references to confidential memory (and address translation cache flushes if any)
and, the addition of the mapping to shared memory - the host may run the TVM
vCPU after the first part, and lazily handle the fault for the second part.
Also the reclamation is of the confidential pages, and the shared memory pages
provided by the host may be unique from those pages so that host has the option
to service the request on the TVM synchronously or asynchronously.

Both sharing and unsharing operations are destructive, i.e., the contents of
memory in the range to be converted are lost.

== Supervisor Domains Enumeration Extension (EID #0x53555044 "SUPD")

This common extension enumerates capabilities for supervisor domains such as
number of active supervisor domains and capabilities of each supervisor domain,
e.g., used for CoVE.

[#sbi_supd_get_active_domains]
=== Function: Enumerate active supervisor domains (FID #0)
[source, C]
-----
struct sbiret sbi_supd_get_active_domains(unsigned long active_domains);

-----

Returns a 64-bit vector with bits set for supervisor domains that are active.
Default value is 1 since supervisor domain 0 is always required (the hosting
domain). For each non-0 position bit set, the SDID with the value of that bit
position may be used per the <<cove-fid>> convention to invoke functions
supported for that domain, e.g., COVH. For active domains, other extensions
may be invoked to get capabilities specific to that domain, e.g., the
`sbi_covh_get_tsm_info` must be invoked to get information from a supervisor
domain supporting CoVE TSM capabilities.

The possible error codes returned in `sbiret.error` are shown below.

                                        unsigned long tvm_identity_addr);
------
Transitions the TVM specified by `tvm_guest_id` from the `TVM_INITIALIZING`
state to a `TVM_RUNNABLE` state. Also, sets the entry point (`ENTRY_PC`) using
`entry_sepc` and boot argument (`ENTRY_ARG`) using `entry_arg` for the boot
vCPU. Both `entry_sepc` and `entry_arg` are included in the measurement
of the TVM. `entry_sepc` is the address in TVM binary to start the boot vCPU
from and `entry_arg` is the address of guest flattened device tree (FDT) and is
passed as an argument to the boot vCPU in `a1` GPR.

`tvm_identity_addr` points to a 64-bytes buffer containing a host-defined TVM
identity. This piece of data can be used to bind TVMs to a host-defined identity
(e.g., an attestation service public key, a guest configuration file hash, an
attestation policy description, etc.). Although this piece of data is included
in the TVM attestation certificate as a dedicated TVM claim (`tvm-identity`), it
is *not* included in the TVM measurements. That allows for the host to
optionally personalize cryptographically identical TVMs through an attestable
and verifiable identity.

The semantics of this piece of data is defined by the host and can be ignored
by both the guest and the attestation services. However, when being used, the
TVM identity can be leveraged as follows:

1. The host passes some information to the guest through, e.g., some out-of-band
VM orchestration mechanisms. This could be, e.g., the hash value for a policy
file the guest is expected to apply at runtime.
2. The guest compares the passed host data with the `tvm-identity` attestation
certificate claim and can decide to use it or not depending on this local
verification process.
3. When requesting a confidential resource, the relying party can check that
the host provided identity data is trustworthy and that the guest measurements
are for a TCB that may have used it.
4. The relying party can choose to release the resource to the guest based on
this verifiable TVM identity.

Giving TVMs an identity is optional and the TSM must not include a TVM identity
claim in the TVM attestation token when `tvm_identity_addr` is set to 0.
When a TVM identity is provided, the `tvm_identity_addr` must be different than
0 and 64B-aligned.

The TSM enforces that a TVM virtual harts cannot be entered unless the TVM
measurement is committed
via this operation. No additional measured pages may be added after this
operation is successfully completed.

struct sbiret sbi_covh_promote_to_tvm(unsigned long fdt_addr,
                                      unsigned long tap_addr,

-----
This intrisic is used by the host to promote a VM to a TVM. It is primarily
intended for CoVE deployment models that require single-step TVM creation
(e.g., <<appendix_d>>). Deployment models that offer multi-step TVM creation
(e.g., <<dep1>>) may, but are not required to, support this ABI as an additional
mechanism for creating TVMs.

The `fdt_addr` is the 8-bytes aligned guest physical address of the guest
flattened device tree (FDT).
The `tap_addr` is the 8-bytes aligned guest physical address of the
`TVM attestation payload` used for local attestation.
For VMs that do not require local attestation (only the remote attestation),
`tap_addr` must be set to `0`.
The `entry_sepc` is the address at which the vCPU execution will resume.
`tvm_identity_addr` is an optional, when set, it points to a 64-bytes buffer
containing a host-defined TVM identity, see `sbi_covh_finalize_tvm()` for more
details.

The VM should be promoted as early in the boot process as possible to minimize
changes in memory contents so that the resulting integrity measurement hashes
are deterministic. The VM must not use registers associated with RISC-V
extensions, e.g., vector, floating point, before promotion, because these
registers will be zeroized during the promotion.

The TSM recreates TVM vCPUs in confidential memory. All TVM vCPUs are in the
reset state, except the TVM Boot vCPU, which is the state of the reflected VM's
vCPU. This VM's vCPU state is reflected using NACL shared memory. The TSM
recreates in confidential memory the reflected VM's data and the VM's page
tables, following the page table configuration defined in HGATP.

Once the TVM's image is completed, the TSM calculates the TVM measurement.
If `tap_addr` is defined, the TSM uses this TVM measurement to authenticate and
authorize the TVM as part of the local attestation procedure.

If successful, the TSM sets the TVM state to `TVM_RUNNABLE` and returns a unique
TVM identifier (`tvm_guest_id`) to the OS/VMM.
The OS/VMM should free the contents of non-confidential memory that contains the
VM's data and the page tables. After this call, the OS/VMM must interact with
this TVM via the TSM using the COVH ABI, i.e., resuming the TVM using the
`sbi_covh_run_tvm_vcpu()` call.

If the call fails, the TSM returns the SBI error code in `sbiret.error` to the
OS/VMM. The possible error codes are shown below.

-------
struct sbiret sbi_covh_destroy_tvm(unsigned long tvm_guest_id);
-------

Destroys a confidential TVM previously created using *`sbi_covh_create_tvm()`*.

Confidential TVM memory is automatically un-assigned following successful
destruction, and it can be assigned to other TVMs. Repurposing confidential
memory for use by non-confidential TVMs requires an explicit call to
*`sbi_covh_reclaim_pages()`* (described below).

TVM destroy verifies that the VMM has stopped all virtual harts execution for
the TVM otherwise this call will fail. The TVM virtual hart may not be entered
after this point. The VMM may start reclaiming TVM memory after this call
succeeds.

The TSM updates the host's `scause` CSR. The host should use the `scause` field
to determine whether the exit was caused by an interrupt or exception, and then
use the additional information in the NACL shared memory region to determine
further course of action (if sbiret.value is 0).

The TSM sets the most significant bit in `scause` to indicate that the exit was
caused by an interrupt, and if this bit is clear, the implication is that the
exit was caused by an exception. The remaining bits are specific information

For each page in the range, the TSM must verify that:

* The page is currently marked present in the TVM’s page table.
* The page is either mapped and uniquely owned by the TVM, or shared and owned
by the host.

After verifying these pre-conditions are met, the TSM then invalidates the

`sbi_covh_tvm_fence()`, in order to complete the invalidation.

Guest page faults taken by the TVM on invalidated pages continue to be reported

== COVE Guest Extension (EID #0x434F5647 "COVG")
The COVE Guest extension supplements the COVE Host extension, and allows TVMs
to communicate with the TSM for the supervisor domain the guest was instantiated
within.
A typical use case for this extension is to relay information to the host.
COVE-Guest calls cause a trap to the TSM. TSM should do any processing required
and then must forward the ECALL to the host with `scause` set to ECALL, `a7` set
to EID, `a6` set to FID (see <<cove-fid>>), `a0`-`a5` set to ECALL args.

-------
Initiates the assignment-change of TVM physical address space starting at
`tvm_gpa_addr` from confidential to non-confidential/shared memory. The
requested range must lie within an existing region of confidential address
space, and may or may not be populated. This ECALL results in an exit to the TSM
which enforces the security properties on the mapping and exits to the VMM
host. The host then removes any confidential pages already populated in the
region and inserts non-confidential pages on page-faults.

The calling TVM vCPU is considered blocked until the assignment-change is
completed. Attempts to run it with `sbi_covh_run_tvm_vcpu()` will fail. Any
guest page faults taken by other TVM vCPUs in the invalidated pages continue to
be reported to the host.

In CoVE implementations that do not support dynamic page conversion between
confidential and non-confidential memory, the TSM reflects this call to the
OS/VMM, which then allocates contiguous non-confidential pages and returns the
host physical address of the first page to the TSM. The TSM maps the
non-confidential pages to the TVM's address space.

In systems with fragmented memory and lack of dynamic page conversion,
the OS/VMM may fail allocating a single large physical memory region that
spans over contiguous non-confidential pages. The TVM should then retry and
request share of multiple smaller memory regions, for example, at the 4 KiB page
size granularity.

Both `tvm_gpa_addr` and `region_len` must be 4 KiB-aligned.

`tvm_gpa_addr` from
shared to confidential. The requested range must lie within an existing region
of non-confidential
address space, and may or may not be populated. This ECALL results in an exit
to the TSM which
enforces the security properties on the mapping and exits to the OS/VMM. The
host then removes
any non-confidential pages already populated in the region and inserts
confidential pages on page-faults.

The calling TVM vCPU is considered blocked until the assignment-change is
completed. Attempts to run it
with `sbi_covh_run_tvm_vcpu()` will fail. Any guest page faults taken by other
TVM vCPUs in the
invalidated pages continue to be reported to the host.

Both `tvm_gpa_addr` and `region_len` must be 4 KiB-aligned.

-------
If the `sbi_covg_get_attcaps` enumerates attestation services provided by
the TSM, then this intrinsic is used by a TVM to get an attestation evidence to
report to a remote relying party.

This intrisic returns an attestation certificate at the address passed as its
fifth argument (`cert_addr_out`). The certificate is signed by the TSM
attestation key, and includes the TVM attestation evidence. The TSM attestion
key is also included in the reported TSM token.

The caller passes the TVM public key address as the first argument
(`pub_key_addr`). This key will be included in the generated certificate and
represents the TSM-certified TVM identity.

The third argument (`challenge_data_addr`) points to the attestation challenge
blob, typically a relying party generated nonce used for demonstrating the
attestation evidence fresheness.

The fourth argument (`cert_format`) is the caller's selected attestation
certificate format. This must be one of the supported
`ATTESTATION_CERTIFICATE_*` flag, per the attestation capabilities reported via
`sbi_covg_get_attcaps`.

All addresses (`pub_key_addr`, `challenge_data_addr` and `cert_addr_out`) must

struct sbiret sbi_covg_retrieve_secret(unsigned long buf_addr,
                                   unsigned long buf_size);
-----
Requests TSM for a secret available after successful local attestation. TSM
reads this secret during local attestation from the `TVM attestation payload`
(TAP). TAP is part of the VM image and is presented to TSM during the TVM
creation via `sbi_covh_promote_to_tvm()`. Only the TVMs that were correctly
authenticated and authorized during local attestation can receive the secret
embedded in TAP.

`buf_addr` is the 4 KiB-aligned address in the TVM address space to which the
TSM will write the secret.
`buf_size` is the length of the buffer. The buffer cannot be larger than the
4 KiB page size.

This ABI will become part of the `Sealing Interface` planned for the CoVE in
version 2.0.

If the call fails, the TSM returns SBI error code in `sbiret.error` to the VM.

== Summary Listing of CoVE functions

=== Summary of CoVE Host Extension (COVH)

|===

| <<sbi_covh_get_tsm_info, sbi_covh_get_tsm_info>> | Used by the OS/VMM to
discover if a TSM is loaded and initialized else returns an error. If a TSM
is loaded and initialized, this operation is used to enumerate TSM
information such as: Confidential memory regions, Size of static memory to
allocate per TVM, Size of memory to allocate per TVM Virtual Hart and so on.

| <<sbi_covh_convert_pages, sbi_covh_convert_pages>> | Begins the process
of converting memory
to be used as confidential memory. The region consists of one or more contiguous
4 KiB memory naturally aligned regions.

| <<sbi_covh_reclaim_pages, sbi_covh_reclaim_pages>> | VMM may unassign
memory for TVMs by destroying them. All confidential-unassigned memory may be
reclaimed back as non-confidential using this interface.

| <<sbi_covh_global_fence, sbi_covh_global_fence>> | This operation
initiates TLB version tracking of pages in the region being converted to
confidential. The TSM enforces that the VMM performs invalidation of all harts
(via IPIs and subsequent sbi_covh_local_fence) to remove any cached mappings to
the memory regions that were previously selected for conversion via the
sbi_covh_convert_pages.

| <<sbi_covh_local_fence, sbi_covh_local_fence>> |  This operation
completes the TLB version tracking of pages in the region being converted to
confidential. The TSM tracks that all available physical harts have executed
this operation before it considers the TLB version updated. The last local fence
completes the conversion of a memory region from non-confidential to
confidential for a set of TVM pages.

| <<sbi_covh_create_tvm, sbi_covh_create_tvm>> | TVM creation (static)
process where a set of TEE pages are assigned for a TVM to hold a TVM’s
global state. This routine also configures the global configuration that
applies to the TVM and affects all TVM hart settings. For example, features
enabled for this TVM, perfmon enabled, debug enabled
etc.

| <<sbi_covh_finalize_tvm, sbi_covh_finalize_tvm>> | This operation enables
the VMM to finalize the measurement of a TVM (initial). The TSM enforces that
the TVM virtual harts cannot be entered unless the TVM measurement is committed
via this operation.

| <<sbi_covh_promote_to_tvm, sbi_covh_promote_to_tvm>>  | Creates a TVM in
a single-step taking the state of an existing VM and recreating it in
confidential memory. It is an alternative approach to creating a TVM in
a multi-step process initiated with `sbi_covh_create_tvm()`.

| <<sbi_covh_destroy_tvm, sbi_covh_destroy_tvm>> | TVM shutdown verifies VMM
has stopped all virtual hart execution for the TVM. The TVM virtual hart
may not be entered after this point. The VMM may start reclaiming TVM
memory after this point.

| <<sbi_covh_add_tvm_memory_region, sbi_covh_add_tvm_memory_region>> | Adds a
memory region to the TVM at the specified range of guest physical address space.
The memory range is confidential to the guest and may only be populated with
confidential pages.

| <<sbi_covh_add_tvm_page_table_pages, sbi_covh_add_tvm_page_table_pages>> | Add
one or more page mappings to the G-stage translation structure for a TVM.
The pages to be used for the G-stage page table structures must have been
converted (and tracked) by the TSM as TEE pages; otherwise this operation will
not succeed.

| <<sbi_covh_add_tvm_measured_pages, sbi_covh_add_tvm_measured_pages>> | Copies
the
given number of pages from non-confidential memory at `source_address` to
confidential
memory at `dest_address`, then measures and maps the pages at `dest_address` in
the TVM physical
address space at `tvm_guest_gpa`. The mapping must lie within a region of
confidential memory
created with `sbi_covh_add_tvm_memory_region()`. This call must not be made
after calling
`sbi_covh_finalize_tvm()`.

This operation is used to extend the initial measurement for a TVM for added
page contents.
The operation performs a SHA384 hash extend to the measurement register managed
by the TSM on the whole page. The GPA at which the page is mapped is also part
of the
measurement operation. The measurement process is a state machine, which means
that the order
in which measured pages are added to the TVM also affects the attestation
evidence. The VMM must
faithfully reproduce the state machine for the measurement process otherwise
the attestation
evidence verification by the relying party will fail and the TVM will not be
considered trustworthy.

| <<sbi_covh_add_tvm_zero_pages, sbi_covh_add_tvm_zero_pages>> | Add a
zero page for an existing mapping for a TVM page (post initialization).
This operation adds a zero page into a mapping and keeps the mapping as
pending, i.e., access from the TVM will fault until the TVM accepts that GPA.

| <<sbi_covh_add_tvm_shared_pages, sbi_covh_add_tvm_shared_pages>> | Maps
the given number of pages of non-confidential memory into the TVM's physical
address space.
The guest physical address must lie within a region of non-confidential memory
previously
defined by the TVM via the guest interface to the TSM.

| <<sbi_covh_create_tvm_vcpu, sbi_covh_create_tvm_vcpu>> | This operation
allows the VMM to assign TEE pages for a virtual hart context structure (VHCS)
for a
specific TVM. This routine also initializes the hart-specific fields of
this structure. Note that a virtual hart context structure may consist of
more than one 4 KiB page. The number of pages are enumerated via the tsm_info
call.

| <<sbi_covh_run_tvm_vcpu, sbi_covh_run_tvm_vcpu>> | Enter or resume a TVM
virtual hart (on any physical hart). A resume operation is performed via a
flag passed to this operation. This operation activates a virtual-hart on a
physical hart, and may be performed only on a TVM virtual hart structure
that is assigned to the TVM and one that is not already active. The TSM
verifies if the operation is performed in the right state for that
virtual hart.

| <<sbi_covh_tvm_fence, sbi_covh_tvm_fence>> | Initiates a TLB invalidation
sequence for all pages that have been invalidated in the given TVM's address
space
since the previous call to `sbi_covh_tvm_fence()`. The TLB invalidation
sequence is
completed when all vCPUs in the TVM that were running before the call to
`sbi_covh_tvm_fence()` have taken a trap into the TSM, which the host can
cause by sending an IPI to the physical CPUs on which the TVM's vCPUs are
running.

| <<sbi_covh_tvm_invalidate_pages, sbi_covh_tvm_invalidate_pages>> |
Invalidates the pages in the specified range of guest physical address space
and thus marks the
pages as blocked from any further TVM accesses. Guest page faults taken by the
TVM on invalidated
pages continue to be reported to the host. The page remains invalid until the
mapping is validated
(marked present), removed, or becomes part of a huge page by promotion/demotion
operation.

| <<sbi_covh_tvm_validate_pages, sbi_covh_tvm_validate_pages>> |
Marks the invalidated pages in the specified range of guest physical address
space
as present. This ECALL may also be used to revert an in-progress page removal or
huge page promotion/demotion sequence.

| <<sbi_covh_tvm_remove_pages, sbi_covh_tvm_remove_pages>> |
Removes mappings for invalidated pages in the specified range of guest physical
address space.
The range to be unmapped must already have been invalidated and fenced, and
must lie within a
removable region of the guest's physical address space.

| sbi_covh_page_relocate                     | Relocate a page for an
existing mapping for a TVM page. This operation allows the VMM to reassign
a new SPA for an existing TVM page mapping. The page mapping must be
invalid and fenced before the page mapping can be
relocated. This interface specification is TBD.

| sbi_covh_page_promote                      | Promote a set of small
page mappings (existing mappings) for a set of TVM pages to a large page
mapping. The affected mappings must be invalidated before the promote operation
can succeed. The VMM may reclaim the freed G-stage page table page if
the operation succeeds. This interface specification is TBD for version 2 of
the ABI.

| sbi_covh_page_demote                    | Demote a large page
mapping for an existing mapping to a set of TVM pages and corresponding
small page mappings. The affected mapping must be invalidated before the
operation can succeed. The VMM must provide a free Confidential memory page to
the TSM to use as a new G-stage page table in the fragmented mapping.
This interface specification is TBD for version 2 of the ABI.

| <<sbi_covi_unbind_aia_imsic_begin, sbi_covi_unbind_aia_imsic_begin>> |
Begins the unbind process for the specified vCPU from its guest interrupt file.

| <<sbi_covi_unbind_aia_imsic_end, sbi_covi_unbind_aia_imsic_end>> |
Completes the unbind process for the specified vCPU from its guest interrupt
files after
a TLB flush sequence for the TVM has been completed.

| <<sbi_covi_inject_tvm_cpu, sbi_covi_inject_tvm_cpu>> |
Injects an external interrupt with the given interrupt_id into the specified
vCPU.

| <<sbi_covi_rebind_aia_imsic_begin, sbi_covi_rebind_aia_imsic_begin>> |
Begins the rebinding process for the specified vCPU to the current physical CPU
and the specified
confidential guest interrupt file. The host must complete a TLB invalidation
sequence
for the TVM before cloning old interrupt file state using
`sbi_covi_rebind_aia_imsic_clone()`.

| <<sbi_covi_rebind_aia_imsic_clone, sbi_covi_rebind_aia_imsic_clone>> |
Clones the old guest interrupt file of the specified vCPU. Caller must make
sure to invoke this from
old physical CPU. The guest interrupt file after this is free to be reclaimed
or bound to another
vCPU.

| <<sbi_covi_rebind_aia_imsic_end, sbi_covi_rebind_aia_imsic_end>> |
Completes the rebind process for the specified vCPU from this physical CPU and
its guest
interrupt files. Must be called from the same physical CPU as
`sbi_covi_rebind_aia_imsic_begin()`.

=== Summary of CoVE Guest Extension (COVG)

|===

| <<sbi_covg_add_mmio_region, sbi_covg_add_mmio_region>> |
Marks the specified range of TVM physical address space starting at
`tvm_gpa_addr` as used for emulated
MMIO. Upon return, all accesses by the TVM within the range are trapped and may
be emulated by the host.

| <<sbi_covg_remove_mmio_region, sbi_covg_remove_mmio_region>> |
Removes the specified range of TVM physical address space starting at
`tvm_gpa_addr` from the emulated
MMIO regions. Upon return, all accesses by the TVM within the range will result
in a page fault.

| <<sbi_covg_share_memory_region, sbi_covg_share_memory_region>> | This
intrinsic is used by the TVM to request the conversion of the specified GPA to
non-confidential (from confidential). The GPA must be mapped to the TVM in a
present state, and must be scrubbed by the TVM before it is yielded. The TSM
enforces that the page is not-present in the G-stage page table and not
tracked as a TEE page. The VMM owns the process of reclaiming the page.

| <<sbi_covg_unshare_memory_region, sbi_covg_unshare_memory_region>> | Convert
a memory region from non-confidential to confidential for a set of TVM pages.
This operation initiates TSM tracking of these pages and also changes the
encryption
properties of these pages. These pages can then be selected by the VMM to
allocate for TVM control structure pages, G-stage page table pages,
and TVM pages.

| <<sbi_covg_allow_external_interrupt, sbi_covg_allow_external_interrupt>> |
Allows injection of the specified external interrupt ID into the calling TVM
vCPU. Passing an `interrupt_id` of the maximum unsigned long value (2^64^-1 on
64-bit architecture) allows injection of all external interrupts. TVM vCPUs
are started with injection of external interrupts completely disabled by default.

| <<sbi_covg_deny_external_interrupt, sbi_covg_deny_external_interrupt>> |
Denies injection of the specified external interrupt ID into the calling TVM
vCPU. Passing an `interrupt_id` of the maximum unsigned long value (2^64^-1 on
64-bit architecture) denies injection of all external interrupts.

| <<sbi_covg_get_attcaps, sbi_covg_get_attcaps>>   | This
intrinsic is used by a TVM to get attestation capabilities supported by the TSM.
the capabilities enumerated are then used to extend measurements and/or get
evidence to support attestation.

| <<sbi_covg_extend_measurement, sbi_covg_extend_measurement>> | This
intrinsic is used by a TVM component to extend the TVM runtime set of
measurement with one additional data blob. The hash function algorithm used to
generate the measurement data must match the `sbi_covg_get_attcaps`
reported one.

| <<sbi_covg_get_evidence, sbi_covg_get_evidence>>      | This
intrinsic is used by a TVM to get an attestation evidence to
report to a remote relying party. It returns an attestation certificate signed
by the TSM attestation key, and includes the TVM attestation evidence. The TSM
attestion key is also included in the reported TSM token.

| <<sbi_covg_retrieve_secret, sbi_covg_retrieve_secret>>      | TVM reads a secret
available after successful local attestation. TSM writes the secret to the
buffer specified by the TVM.

| <<sbi_covg_read_measurement, sbi_covg_read_measurement>>      | This
intrisic returns a the TVM measurement register value for the `msmt_index`
measurement register. TVMs can read both initial and runtime measurement
register values back.

| sbi_covg_enable_debug      | This intrinsic is supported by the TSM to
enable the TVM to request for debugging to be enabled for the TVM (TSM
invokes TSM-driver to enable debugging if the TVM was created with debug
opt-in; TSM enforces state save and restore of debug state for TVM hart).
The specification of this interface is TBD.

| sbi_covg_enable_perfmon   | This intrinsic is supported by the TSM to
enable the TVM to request performance monitoring (where the TSM enforces
state save and restore of the performance monitoring inhibit and trigger
controls). The specification of this interface is TBD.
