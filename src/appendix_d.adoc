== Appendix D: M-mode TSM based deployment model

This deployment model targets high-assurance systems whose design might be
constrained
by real-time and formal verification requirements. It trade offs a feature-rich
design supporting
dynamic resource allocation, for simpler implementation, where the correctness
can be formally verified.

=== Overview
<<dep3>> shows that the deployment model supports a single confidential
supervisor domain in which
the TSM runs along with the TSM driver in the M-mode. This single confidential
supervisor domain can run multiple
TVMs that are isolated from each other using the MMU, i.e., G-stage page tables
managed by TSM. TSM isolates the
hosting supervisor domain (i.e., OS/VMM and non-confidential applications and
VMs) from the confidential supervisor
domain (TSM and TVMs) using a hardware memory isolation mechanism, like PMP.
The Supervisor Domain Access Protection (Smmtt) extension is therefore not
required in this model but not precluded.
IO accesses to confidential memory must be prevented, for example, with IOPMP.

[NOTE]
====
Since the TSM is not required to run in the HS-mode, this deployment model
supports systems that emulate the
hypervisor extension or run TVMs and OS/VMM in S-mode. The latter requires use
of a hardware memory isolation mechanism
that enforces memory accesses to confidential memory while being only
controlled by the TSM, e.g., PMP.
====

=== Static memory partitioning
The deployment model proposes static partitioning of memory into confidential
and non-confidential to simplify
formal reasoning about the correctness of the TVM execution and isolation. TSM
performs this paritioning early
during the boot of the platform, resulting in the following advantages: (1)
simplified formal reasoning about the
ownership of memory, (2) attestation that covers static system configuration
(e.g., values of PMP registers),
(3) reduced attack surface between OS/VMM and TSM due to narrower ABI. A
possible negative consequence of
static partitioning is underutilization of resources. Specifically,
confidential memory created at platform
initialization might be larger than the required amount of memory utilized by
TVMs and the TSM during runtime.
Lack of the conversion mechanism of confidential memory pages to
non-confidential memory (enabled for example by Smmtt)
prevents the hosting supervisor domain (OS/VMM, applications, and VMs) from
using the memory over-provisioned by
the confidential supervisor domain (TSM, TVMs).

=== TVM creation
To reduce the complexity of the TSM implementation, the TSM creates a TVM as a
result of a single operation triggered with
the `sbi_covh_promote_to_tvm()` call. Specifically, OS/VMM initializes and
starts a regular VM, which early during the
boot process requests to be promoted to a TVM. This call traps in the OS/VMM
and is reflected to the TSM, which copies
VM's data, the page table configuration, and the vCPU state into confidential
memory. If the request fails, the promotion
of a VM to a TVM fails and error is returned to the VM. When the request
succeeds, OS/VMM marks the VM as a TVM,
so that it can then properly resume its execution via TSM.

=== Local attestation
Embedded systems might operate without access to a network, which prevents use
of remote attestation. For this
reason, this deployment model also supports local attestation, in which the TSM
attests to the integrity of the TVM image
during its creation and allows its creation only when it contains a specfic
`TVM attestation payload` (TAP). This
payload carries a cryptographic proof issued with the expected attestation key
specific to the TSM integrity
and platform configuration. The pointer to TAP is passed in a call to promote a
VM to a TVM. If it is zero,
then remote attestation is used, otherwise local attestation is used. Local
attestation is strongest when it is hardware enforced.
The TSM must verify that the attestation (i.e., integrity measurements, configuration of the hardware
platform) of the TVM match the values specified by the TVM creator in the TAP.

Local attestation utilizes one or more of the following properties:

. The TSM must be able to verify that a TVM creator authorized the TVM to run on the platform.
. The TSM enforces that only TVMs created by a trusted partner runs on the hardware.

Separate mechanisms may be used to achieve these goals.

==== TVM Authorization
The TSM must have a list of public keys of those authorized to sign VMs (TVMs)
for execution on the platform. The attestation payload associated with the TVM
will be
signed with a private key. When the VM is being promoted to a TVM, TSM checks
the signature inside the TAP.
If the signature is not valid, the TSM will not convert the VM and will
terminate execution of the
VM. The method for provisioning these public keys into the TSM is outside the
scope of this specification.

==== Verifying Platform configuration
When the creator of the (authorized) TVM does not want it to execute on
improperly configured or unauthorized hardware, there should be a mechanism
supported by hardware (and firmware) for verification.
Assuming presence of the hardware root-of-trust for measurement and hardware
root-of-trust for storage, the VM can be created with an encrypted disk and the
key that is used to decrypt the disk can be sealed to the measurments of the
platform.
The creator of the VM using the specifications for the platform decides what
values are required in order for the key to be released.
When the request to promote VM to a TVM is called and local attestation is
successful, the TSM unseals the key with help of the hardware root-of-trust. At
the point when the TVM needs to decrypt its disk (e.g., for mounting the
filesystem), the TVM utilizes an ABI call (`sbi_covg_retrieve_secret()`) to
retrieve the decryption key from the TSM.

=== Further recommendations
Embedded systems with real-time requirements must have a fixed upper bounded
execution time. This requires determining
the maximal number of instructions that can execute between TVM context
switches. From this reason, this deployment model
recommends an uninterruptible TSM. <<depd2>> shows this operation mode, in
which TSM running in M-mode exposes COVH and
COVG ABI to OS/VMM and TVM, respectively. VM ECALLs trap directly to TSM due to
the `medeleg` configuration and all
interrupts during TVM execution trap in TSM due to the `mideleg` configuration.
